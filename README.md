# Unit 19 PWA Homework: Text Editor (Modified Edition)

# Text Editor
## Description

```

The text editor web application features a client-server folder structure visible upon opening in the editor. 

Running npm run start from the root directory initiates both the backend and serves the client.

The application's JavaScript files are bundled using Webpack, resulting in a generated HTML file, service worker, and manifest file.

It supports next-gen JavaScript without errors in the browser. 

The text editor immediately creates a database storage using IndexedDB upon opening. 

Content entered is saved in IndexedDB when the user clicks off the DOM window and retrieved upon reopening. 

An Install button allows downloading the app as a desktop icon. 

The application registers a service worker with Workbox for pre-caching static assets and subsequent pages.
